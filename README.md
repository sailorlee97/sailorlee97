- 💬 Program & Research: **malicious traffic identification project** 

* * **Background**: A core, high-level, and confidential sub-topic of a major national-level subject, based on domestically developed NP and AI chips, a set of malicious traffic identification and detection systems have been developed.


 * * 1. Using DPI technology to identify the traffic collected on the chip, you can locate the malicious traffic, and then extract the features of the unidentified traffic;
 * * 2. Two-classification and multi-classification model training of malicious traffic;
 * * 3. The traffic that DPI fails to recognize is identified by the two-class and multi-class model.
