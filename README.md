- 💬 Project & Research: 

- **Malicious traffic identification** 

  * **Background**: Based on domestically NP and AI chips, we have developed malicious traffic identification and detection systems.

   -  Using DPI technology to identify the traffic collected on the chip, you can locate the malicious traffic, and then extract the features of the unidentified traffic;
   -  Two-classification and multi-classification model training of malicious traffic;
   -  The traffic that DPI fails to recognize is identified by the two-class and multi-class model.

   -  **Patents**：Semi-supervised network traffic anomaly detection method based on generative adversarial networks，Chinese national invention patent, CN115174178B, 20230704
- **Research on algorithms for identifying traffic service types** (R&d with ZTE)
   
  * **Background**:  In order to ensure the network service quality of the router, this project investigates the key technology of router traffic information classification based on AI (Artificial Intelligence) technology.

- **Deep learning system based on radiomics applied to brain surgery** 
  
  * **Background**: Based on imaging omics, machine learning methods were used to determine whether co-deletion of 1P /19q genes existed. The method is noninvasive and has great potential for treatment.
