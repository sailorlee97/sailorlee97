- 💬 Project & Research: 

- **Malicious traffic identification** 

  * **Background**: Based on domestically NP and AI chips, we have developed malicious traffic identification and detection systems.

   -  Using DPI technology to identify the traffic collected on the chip, you can locate the malicious traffic, and then extract the features of the unidentified traffic;
   -  Two-classification and multi-classification model training of malicious traffic;
   -  The traffic that DPI fails to recognize is identified by the two-class and multi-class model.

- **Deep learning system based on radiomics applied to brain surgery** 
  
  * **Background**: Based on imaging omics, machine learning methods were used to determine whether co-deletion of 1P /19q genes existed. The method is noninvasive and has great potential for treatment.
