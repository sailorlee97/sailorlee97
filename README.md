- 💬 Program & Research: **malicious traffic identification project** 

 * **Background**: Based on domestically developed NP and AI chips, a set of malicious traffic identification and detection systems have been developed.


   -  Using DPI technology to identify the traffic collected on the chip, you can locate the malicious traffic, and then extract the features of the unidentified traffic;
   -  Two-classification and multi-classification model training of malicious traffic;
   -  The traffic that DPI fails to recognize is identified by the two-class and multi-class model.
